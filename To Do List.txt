FUNCTIONAL
-Program should automatically generate 4 "Reflections" pages that are simply identical to Reflections2 pages.  Just in case there are any links out there pointing to "Reflections", we may as well keep it maintained.
--Reflections.html, ReflectionsName.html, ReflectionsRarity.html, ReflectionsType.html

-Program should automatically generate the 4 "Premium" pages.  This will be done by saving them in a template TXT file and using a wildcard for the sidebar that needs updating.
--Premium.html, PremiumRarity.html, PremiumName.html, PremiumType.html
--Currently I have been updating the sidebar of the 4 premium pages manually.

-Program should connect directly to the current JSON files online (can it access them via Scomp?) instead of requiring a local copy that could be outdated.

-Update the How To Use.txt file after making some of these quality of life changes



VISUAL
-Improve upon weird Set List headings that are black rectangles above each list.  (One combined heading?)

-Better color scheme and other styles

-Better set banners (Set 19 is acceptable quality, Set 0 is not)
--Set banners don't require the name of the set but we may wish to make it more prominent below the banner



CODE CLEANUP
-Replace hard-coded paths with config file variables

-Replace hard-coded maxVSet variable with config info, or by pulling from Sets.json

-Update the How To Use.txt file after making some of these quality of life changes

-Update pages to use logo_swccgpc.gif from the /images folder instead of the /cardlists folder

-Clean up unused Amazon S3 files, especially entire contents of /cardlists/images/starwars/ (do we think they are being linked from anywhere?)



WISHLIST
-JSON Rulings and other info overlay on right side (or left side? or under card?)
--Or a tiny "More Info" link under the card that opens the card in Scomp

-Separate banners for Reflections 2 and Reflections 3

-Automatically update card lists
