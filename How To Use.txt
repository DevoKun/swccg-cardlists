ADDING A NEW SET

So, a new set has been released and isn't showing up on the card lists page, and you got stuck figuring out how to add it?

1. As of Sept 2022, you have to edit the program to add a new set.  Sorry.  Download/Install Visual Studio 2019

2. Update the program by open the .sln file in Visual Studio 2019 and make these upates in Form1.cs:
--In the button1_click function, update the maxVSet variable.  Currently its 219, indicating Set 19.  To add Set 20, you'd change this to 220.

3. The program also has some hard-coded file paths (sorry again).
--ProcessSet function has 4 lines with hard-coded paths of where you want the HTML files to get dumped. Update to whatever works for you.
--BuildPage function has 1 line with THREE paths in it, indicating the locations of PagePart1.txt, PagePart2.txt, and PagePart3.txt.  Update ALL THREE accordingly.
--GetCardList function has 1 line indicating where your JSON files are.  Make sure you have the latest JSON files (get from swccg-card-json github) - Dark, Light, DarkLegacy, LightLegacy, and sets.json

4. Finally you can build the program with your changes (F6) and then run the program (F5).
-When you run the program, a button appears.  Click the button and wait a minute for the success message which says "File(s) Written"

5. The Premium pages are not auto-generated yet (sorry) but they are easy to update manually.
-Premium.html, PremiumRarity.html, PremiumName.html, PremiumType.html
-Just download/open the existing file, scroll down to the part where the Vsets are listed in the sidebar (around line 186) and insert a line to link to the new Vset.

6. Log into Amazon S3 and upload these HTML files (you should have about 200 such files) to /cardlists
-Yes, upload ALL ~200 of them, not just the new set. We need to update all the other pages sidebars

7. Issue an invalidation to clear the old pages out of cache
-https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/v3/home?region=ca-central-1#/distributions/E4R02360UW5RJ/invalidations
-Create Invalidation:
/cardlists/*

8. Do some testing to see how the pages look.  Good, hopefully!

9. Oops, did you notice that the new Vset page doesn't have an image banner? You'll need to make one.
-Banner size is 735 x 93
-Upload banner to Amazon S3. File name and path must be exactly like this (using Set 20 as an example): /cardlists/images/SET19_title.gif



UPDATING THE PAGE HTML
-PagePart1.txt, PagePart2.txt, and PagePart3.txt form a sort of template.  Updating these files (for example, adding text) will affect all pages produced by the program.
-Additionally, updating swccg2.css will allow for simple things like swapping colors etc.
